# Pick-n-Track
This project revolutionizes supply chain management by merging blockchain technology with advanced order-picking optimization. It ensures that every product is authenticated and its journey is transparent from manufacturer to consumer. Administrators secure the system, manufacturers register products with unique QR codes, and suppliers utilize a sophisticated order-picking model to optimize routes and reduce picking time. This system streamlines operations, lowers costs, and enhances inventory management. Consumers, in turn, can easily verify a product's authenticity, ensuring trust and delivering a seamless experience.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to revolutionize supply chain management by ensuring product authenticity and optimizing the order-picking process in warehouse operations. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to provide a secure and transparent system that tracks products from manufacturer to consumer, preventing counterfeiting and building consumer trust. Simultaneously, the project focuses on enhancing warehouse efficiency through advanced order-picking optimization, reducing operational costs, and improving overall supply chain performance.
## Features
##Counterfeiting in the Supply Chain:

- *Issue*: The presence of counterfeit products in the market undermines consumer trust, damages brand reputation, and results in significant financial losses.
-*Solution*: The system uses blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof record of each product's journey from manufacturer to retailer. The integration of QR codes allows consumers to verify the authenticity of products, effectively combating counterfeiting.

##Lack of Transparency and Traceability:

-*Issue*: Consumers and stakeholders often have limited visibility into the origin and movement of products within the supply chain, leading to uncertainty and potential fraud.
-*Solution*: The blockchain ledger provides full transparency, allowing every entity involved to view and verify the product’s history. This ensures that all transactions and updates are traceable, fostering greater trust throughout the supply chain.

##Inefficiencies in Order-Picking Processes:

-*Issue*: Traditional order-picking processes in warehouses are often inefficient, leading to increased time and costs, mismanagement of inventory, and delays in order fulfillment.
-*Solution*: The order-picking optimization model integrated at the supplier stage minimizes the time required to pick items, optimizes vehicle routes, and efficiently manages inventory. This leads to faster order processing, reduced labor costs, and more effective use of resources.

##Inconsistent Inventory Management:

-*Issue*: Poorly managed inventory can result in overstocking or stockouts, leading to financial losses and customer dissatisfaction.
-*Solution*: The system’s picking methods, such as single order, batch, and zone batch picking, streamline the inventory management process. By ensuring that all items are picked efficiently and accurately, the system helps maintain optimal inventory levels.

##Complexity in Multi-Intermediary Supply Chains:

-*Issue*: In supply chains involving multiple intermediaries, there is a risk of information loss, delays, and discrepancies in product handling.
Solution: By enabling each intermediary (supplier) to update product information on the blockchain, the system ensures that all data is consistent and up-to-date, reducing the chances of errors and delays.

##Limited Consumer Access to Product Information:

-*Issue*: Consumers often lack easy access to detailed information about the products they purchase, making it difficult to assess authenticity and quality.
-*Solution*: The system provides consumers with a simple QR code scanning method to access comprehensive product details, including the entire supply chain journey, ensuring informed purchasing decisions.
##usage
This system is used across various stages of the supply chain, starting from manufacturers who register products on the blockchain, to suppliers who benefit from optimized warehouse operations. Retailers can ensure the authenticity of the products they sell, while consumers gain confidence in their purchases by easily verifying product history through QR codes. The order-picking optimization feature is particularly valuable for warehouse managers, allowing them to streamline operations, minimize picking times, and optimize resource allocation, leading to more efficient and cost-effective warehouse management.
